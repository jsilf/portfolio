              I am studying to become a frontend developer by summer 2023. So
              far I have learned a lot about problem solving, how to plan and
              design my own projects, work with git in groups, and build
              websites with libraries and frameworks. Love learning new things,
              but also work on getting better at what I already know.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tech I currently work with is HTML5, CSS3/SCSS, JavaScript,
              TypeScript, Node.js. Frameworks and libraries such as React.js,
              Next.js, Express.js. Databases MongoDB and MySQL.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
    </>

};
